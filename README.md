# Queens
Haskell solution to an old problem

Since Max Bezzel published the eight queens puzzle in 1848 (Berliener Schachzeitung), many matematicians (including Gauss and Dijkstra) have been occupied by it. F. Nauck was the first who offered a complete solution containing 92 dependant possibilities.

I met this problem when I was a student (Занимљиви математички проблеми - М. Петковић) and I was a bit terrified by the complicated Fortran code which was given in the book. I didn't even try to realize it. These days I've tried to play with this problem using Haskell. And, it's unusual how simple the solution can be. Then, I've tried to play with a related "Nine queens" problem... I still don't understand whether the complete solution is currently unknown or not, but - there are 64 independent solutions and my Haskell code is here!
